com.google.AndroidStudio Flatpak manifest without extra data
=============================================================

This is a fork of the [com.google.AndroidStudio Flatpak manifest](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.AndroidStudio)
with the extra data removed and embedded like a regular Flatpak.

The output of the build can be installed offline or packaged without any
online dependencies.

Because Google does not want Android Studio to be redistributed, Flatpak from
this manifest cannot be made available publicly, but you can always build your
own for offline installation.  This is not legal advice, please check
with your legal counsel.
